# AdvertiseMe
This is a online advertising platform I came up with as project for while I was studying at the university (in 2012). The platform provides advertisers to
integrate a recommender engine (same as Amazon, Ebay, etc) and mobile technologies such as QR codes and location based services.
 
Online advertising platform which uses data mining technologies to profile user behaviour to better cater requirements of both seller and buyer

Description:

This is a mobile application which integrates mobile technology and data mining technologies to provide a more user friendly way to communicate the messages to the public.

When a particular advertiser needs to carry out more information about the product or the service that he/she advertise about, in a paper based media he or she can use a QR code in the advertisement. For a person who has the mobile application installed in the smart mobile device can scan the QR code, and then the additional content would be displayed accordingly. Content could be a video file, audio file or an image.

By tracking the behaviors of the individual activities and using a data mining algorithm and collaborative filtering a unique profile could be provided for the each person (A hybrid data mining algorithm will have to be generated as suit for the context using existing algorithms) For an example if a particular person is interested in buying a property from near the Colombo metropolitan area, with intended details (Video clip of the property) suggestions can be provided.
Furthermore users are allowed to rate and comment on the particular product or the service that he/she is viewed. These ratings and comments can be used for customer segmenting and product or service evaluations
